## 🚀 About Me 
I’m a Statistics student from UiTM with a minor in Big Data Analytics (CGPA: 3.68). I am passionate about transforming complex, messy datasets into clear stories and actionable insights that solve real business problems.

My expertise lies in navigating the full data life cycle—from cleaning and modeling to visualization. I enjoy the "aha!" moment when data reveals something new and useful, whether it’s identifying a healthcare trend or optimizing operational workflows.

🛠️ Technical Toolkit
Data Analysis & Stats: R, Python, SPSS, Excel

Data Visualization: Power BI (Check out my Diabetes Analysis dashboard below!)

Methodologies: Data Science Life Cycle (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, Interpret)

📈 Highlighted Experience
Academic Projects: Developed a comprehensive Diabetes Analysis project using 100,000 records to identify high-risk demographic patterns.

Problem Solving: Currently building the i-SACR mobile app concept to assist with student conflict resolution and burnout management.

Collaborative Leadership: Beyond the numbers, my experience in various event roles has sharpened my teamwork, communication, and time management skills in fast-paced environments.

🔍 Looking for Growth
I am currently seeking an internship where I can apply my analytical skills to real-world industry challenges and contribute to data-driven decision-making.
When I’m not coding or analyzing trends, I’m likely gaming, practicing my Mandarin and Japanese, or keeping up with my favorite anime series like Tokyo Ghoul.
